**Title:** Pairs Trading Algorithm for Financial Markets (#FC24OPS2)

**Introduction:**

This project implements a pairs trading algorithm designed to exploit price discrepancies between two correlated stocks in the IT sector on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. The strategy utilizes statistical methods, particularly cointegration, to identify co-movement between the chosen stocks. The project report details the backtesting process and performance metrics.

**Technology Stack:**

* Programming Language (Specify the language used for the backtesting script, e.g., Python, R)
* Libraries/Frameworks (Mention any specific libraries used for data analysis, model development, etc.)
* Data Source (Indicate the source of historical price data for the stocks)

**Installation (if applicable):**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pairs-trading-algorithm.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies (Provide instructions for installing required libraries)

**Usage:**

1. Download historical price data for the chosen stocks (Specify format and location)
2. Modify the script (Mention specific files or configurations to be adjusted)
3. Run the backtesting script (Provide instructions or commands)

**Results:**

The backtesting report provides an overview of the following performance metrics for the period 2019-2020:

* **Annualized Returns:** 2.1891%
* **Total Returns:** (Calculated based on initial and final book size)
* **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.9483
* **Maximum Drawdown:** -0.63%
* **Win-Loss Ratio:** 1.75
* **Information Ratio:** 0.748
* **Transaction Costs:** 0.7488%

**Disclaimer:**

This project and its results are for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Backtesting performance does not guarantee future results.

**Further Development:**

* Explore alternative cointegration techniques.
* Investigate dynamic transaction cost models.
* Optimize entry/exit thresholds (z-score) based on historical data.
* Implement live trading capabilities (with proper risk management).
